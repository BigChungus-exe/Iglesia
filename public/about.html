      <p style='text-align: justify;'>Centro Shalom, as a church, exists to glorify God by sharing the good news of the gospel to those who are ignored and marginalized.  
          We strive to embody God’s grace and love while pointing people to the true peace and plentitude that only God can give.  
          At Centro Shalom, we have a very special calling to children and teens, while understanding that a strong church is made of 
          strong families.  We know that God has put us strategically in neighborhoods with enormous economic need, yet with a more 
          profound spiritual need.  We embrace this calling as an honor and a privilege.  We prepare our hearts to diligently study the word 
          of God, to practice the word of God and to teach the word of God (Ezra 7:10) so that God can cause an immediate and permanent impact 
          on lives that will radiate in our communities through changed individuals and families.

      <p style='text-align: justify;'>During the mid 1980s, Fernando Martinez, a middle-school teacher, became aware of a humanitarian crisis in the city of Tijuana. Many families 
          were migrating to the border hoping to cross into the United States for a better life. The fathers would go first, often never to return. 
          Mothers and children were left to fend for themselves, living in shacks built from pallets, cardboard, and tarps. Fernando realized that 
          the children had no opportunity to go to school, since the government did not provide services for these migrants...</p>

          <p style='text-align: justify;'>During the mid 1980s, Fernando Martinez, a middle-school teacher, became aware of a humanitarian crisis in the city of Tijuana. Many families 
              were migrating to the border hoping to cross into the United States for a better life. The fathers would go first, often never to return. 
              Mothers and children were left to fend for themselves, living in shacks built from pallets, cardboard, and tarps. Fernando realized that 
              the children had no opportunity to go to school, since the government did not provide services for these migrants.</p>
          
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>Fernando established a small center in the Mirimar area of the city in a building donated by the owner with the stipulation that it be used for 
              children’s ministries. His volunteer group of ministry-trained teenagers found a way to expand the ministry to families by providing dry goods 
              and clothing at several locations in the poorer neighborhoods. In 1990 Salvador Suazo was one of the many boys that Fernando mentored.  Salvador
              would later become the teaching pastor under Fernando at Centro Shalom in the year 2007.</p>
          
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>In 2003, the ministry purchased land in the Alamar community adjacent to the area where hundreds of people lived in poverty. It was Fernando’s 
              dream to establish a church which would minister to both spiritual and humanitarian needs. Centro Shalom de Tijuana became a beacon of light in 
              Alamar.  It provided spiritual guidance with church services and humanitarian aid: clean drinking water, food, clothing, blankets, and child 
              sponsorships so that children who could not afford school were able to receive an education.  In 2012, the government relocated most of the 
              residents away from the property so that a highway could be built. Since the people were now far away from the church, a need arose for a bus 
              ministry to transport them back to the Alamar complex.</p>
          
           
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>In 2017, Pastor Fernando passed away. His legacy lives on in the facilities, the families, and the leadership of the church.  
              Pastor Fernando invested deeply in the lives of many and the ministry of Centro Shalom is still benefitting from his diligence and love 
              of people. The teaching pastor at the time of Fernando’s passing was Salvador Suazo. Following Fernando’s death, Salvador was asked to
              take over the director position of the ministry in addition to his role as pastor.</p>
          
          
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>The heartbeat of the Centro Shalom ministry is the desire to give the people of Tijuana their deepest need: Jesus. The church provides 
              spiritual guidance and training so that members can live out the gospel of Jesus Christ to reach their community and change lives. This 
              takes place in many forms: weekly church meetings on campus, home churches that reach the neighborhoods through the Vines Ministry, 
              a before and after school program for children called Manna, a child sponsorship program that enables kids a chance to go to school, an
              onsite Cross Fit gym that serves to physically improve the participants and provides a platform to share the gospel, seminary classes
              to better equip the church to meet the spiritual needs of the community and countless humanitarian outreaches.</p>
          
           
          <p style='text-align: justify;'>Those who know this ministry are excited to see the direction the church is going.  May the church of Centro Shalom listen closely to God’s voice,
              follow His direction, walk in boldness and light, and serve faithfully!  Most importantly, may God receive all the glory for all He has done, 
              is doing, and will continue to do through Centro Shalom.</p>
